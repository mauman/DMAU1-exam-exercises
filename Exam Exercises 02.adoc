== Relational Algebra

[.exercise]
--
Consider a database with the following schema, describing a manufacturer's operations:

[source, subs="verbatim, quotes"]
----
PRODUCTS ([underline]#ID#, Description, UnitPrice)
WAREHOUSES ([underline]#ID#, Address)
STOCKS ([underline]#ProductID#, [underline]#WarehouseID#, Units)
----

[NOTE]
====
* The set of each relation's underlined attributes indicates its *key*
* `STOCKS` instances describe how many _products' units_ are stocked and in which _warehouses_. When a product is stocked, its `Units>=1`.
====

Write *relational algebra expressions* for the following queries:

1. For each product whose stock is equal or larger than 10 units, _in any warehouse_, get both:

** the product's data (`ID`, `Description` and `UnitPrice`)
** the addresses of all the warehouses where at least 10 product units are stocked.

2. Find the `ID`, `Description` and `UnitPrice` of the products that _aren't_ stocked at all, anywhere.

=== Answer

Start by identifying the relations that contain needed data. In this case, all of them are required, as:

* `STOCKS` contains the number of stocked units for each product
* `PRODUCTS` holds the data for products details
* `WAREHOUSES` includes the addresses

The easiest query involves:

1. joining the three relations together, via *theta joins* where appropriate
2. performing a *selection* on the resulting relation, by filtering those tuples whose `Units` are equal or higher than 10
3. using a *projection* to pick out the attribute values we require

WARNING: `PRODUCTS` and `WAREHOUSES` both feature an `ID` attribute, although these identify tuples in different relations, with different meanings. It wouldn't make sense to perform a *natural join* between them.

Let {r} identify the desired data:

[.relational-algebra]
{r} = {sigma}[.ras]##Units≥10## STOCKS ⨝[.ras]##WarehouseID=ID## WAREHOUSES ⨝[.ras]##ProductID=PRODUCTS.ID## PRODUCTS

A less efficient _alternative_, due to more _joins_, could be:

[.relational-algebra]
{r} = {sigma}[.ras]##Units≥10## (WAREHOUSES ⨝[.ras]##ID=WarehouseID## STOCKS ⨝[.ras]##ProductID=PRODUCTS.ID## PRODUCTS)

We then need to select the relevant attributes, via a *projection* on {r}:

[.relational-algebra]
{pi}[.ras]##PRODUCTS.ID, Description, UnitPrice, Address## ({r})
--

.RelaX Code
[source]
----
r = σ Units >= 10 STOCKS ⨝ WarehouseID = ID WAREHOUSES ⨝ ProductID = PRODUCTS.ID PRODUCTS
π PRODUCTS.ID, Description, UnitPrice, Address (r)
----

=== Answer

TIP: Tackle this class of problems by relying on *set differences*. The tuples that _don't_ meet the selection criteria are first collected and then removed from the set of all the candidate tuples.

In this case we don't need to query the `WAREHOUSES` relation, seeing as it contains no relevant data for our purposes.

WARNING: Products that _aren't_ stocked _don't appear_ in `STOCKS` instances; there are no such tuples whose `Units` value is `0`.

[.answer]
--
Let {r} be the relation which includes the data of all those products we aren't interested in:

[.relational-algebra]
{r} = {pi}[.ras]##ID, Description, UnitPrice## (PRODUCTS ⨝[.ras]##ID=ProductID## STOCKS)

We are selecting *all* the tuples that match stocked products, referenced in `STOCKS` via the `ProductID` attribute. _Unstocked_ products, absent from `STOCKS`, won't be included in the _join_.

We finally *subtract* the data of all stocked products, {r}, from the set of all products (stocked and otherwise):

[.relational-algebra]
PRODUCTS - {r}
--

NOTE: The initial *projection* ensures that the two relations' schemas are *compatible*, as required by the *subtraction*.

.RelaX Code

----
PRODUCTS - π ID, Description, UnitPrice (PRODUCTS ⨝ ID = ProductID STOCKS)
