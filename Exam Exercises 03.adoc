== Relational Algebra

[.exercise]
--
Consider a database with the following schema, describing theatrical performances:

[source, subs="verbatim, quotes"]
----
THEATRE ([underline]#TheatreID#, Name, City)
PLAY ([underline]#Title#, Author)
PERFORMANCE ([underline]#TheatreID#, [underline]#Date#, Title)
----

[NOTE]
====
* The set of each relation's underlined attributes indicates its *key*
* Multiple theatres, sharing the same name, can be present in different cities. Bologna and Florence both have a "Teatro Comunale", for example.
====

Write *relational algebra expressions* for the following queries:

1. Find the `Name` of the theatres, in *Rome*, where plays by *"Pirandello"* were performed in *2020*.

2. Get the `Title` of the plays that were performed *exclusively* in Rome's theatres.
--

=== Answer

Start by identifying the relations that contain needed data. In this case, all of them are required, as:

* `THEATRE` provides both the cities and the theatre names we're after
* `PLAY` holds data concerning the play's author
* `PERFORMANCE` ties theatres and plays together

The easiest query consists of *joining* the three relations and *selecting* those tuples whose city is "Rome" _and_ whose actor is "Pirandello" which _also_ are within the appropriate date range.

WARNING: Pay attention to the *joins*' order, so that any two operands share a compatible attribute. In this case *natural joins* will suffice.

Define [.literal]#r# as the relation stemming from:

[.relational-algebra]
{sigma}[.ras]##City=Roma {and} Author=Pirandello {and} Date≥01-01-2020 {and} Date≤31-12-2020## (THEATRE {X} PERFORMANCE {X} PLAY)

Conclude by *projecting* on `Name`, a unique attribute within {r}:

[.relational-algebra]
{pi}[.ras]##Name## {r}

Or retrieve {r} more _efficiently_ by *selecting* the relevant tuples _before_ *joining* them:

[.relational-algebra]
{sigma}[.ras]##City=Roma## THEATRE {X} {sigma}[.ras]##Date≥01-01-2020 {and} Date≤31-12-2020## PERFORMANCE {X} {sigma}[.ras]##Author=Pirandello## PLAY
--

=== Answer

The attribute values within `PERFORMANCE` and `THEATRE` are sufficient to obtain the plays' titles. `PLAY` is unnecessary, as it contains authors' names.

While performing selections, tuples are either included _or_ discarded sequentially. Consider a join between `THEATRE` and `PERFORMANCE`, then a selection based on the resulting tuples' cities; were we to include a tuple whose city is "Rome" and whose title is "King Lear", it wouldn't be possible to remove it when we encounter a subsequent tuple with an equal title but a different city.

TIP: Tackle this class of problems by relying on *set differences*. The tuples that _don't_ meet the selection criteria are first collected and then removed from the set of all the candidate tuples.

[.answer]

Let us define {r} which gathers the titles of all the plays that *weren't* performed in Rome:

* *join* `THEATRE` and `PERFORMANCE`, whose data are essential
* *select* the tuples whose `City` attribute is *different* from _Rome_
* *project* on `Title`

[.relational-algebra]
{pi}[.ras]##Title## {sigma}[.ras]##City≠Rome## (THEATRE {X} PERFORMANCE)

Alternatively, a more _efficient_ query would narrow down the tuples in `THEATRE`:

[.relational-algebra]
{pi}[.ras]##Title## ({sigma}[.ras]##City≠Rome## THEATRE {X} PERFORMANCE)

It's now sufficient to remove {r} from the projection of `PERFORMANCE` on `Title`:

[.relational-algebra]
{pi}[.ras]##Title## (PERFORMANCE) - {r}

NOTE: Since `PLAY`'s key is `Title`, which therefore uniquely identifies each play, it could be used in lieu of `PERFORMANCE`, in the query above. It might even be more efficient on account of its lower tuple count.
--

[WARNING]
====
The following query is wrong, as it includes plays that were performed in Rome *and* in other cities, therefore *not exclusively* in Rome:

[.relational-algebra]
{pi}[.ras]##Title## {sigma}[.ras]##City=Rome## (THEATRE {X} PERFORMANCE)
====

== Annex
=== The date format
In his exercises Prof. Marsico used the widely known dd/mm/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy format, which: even though more readable, familiar and, depending on the context, useful for some, is otherwise prone to inefficiencies (added complexity for the machine) and human errors.

We all know the usual debate but this, because we are trying to work with machines, is a problem which has to be addressed. When working with machinery and stuff that should be read by people from all walks of life (be they dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy or _else_ users) a standard should be chosen: in this case the `ISO 8601`.

=== More efficiency
The design of the second query suggest that higher performance can be achieved by cutting on the amount of handled data as early as possible. This matter is explored no further, but we are missing on something: theatres usually host the same play multiple times! Thus we can further lower the amount of tuples used in the join operation by doing:

[.relational-algebra]
k = THEATRE {X} {pi}[.ras]##TheatreID, Title## (PERFORMANCE)

({pi}[.ras]##Title## ({sigma}[.ras]##City=Rome## k)) - ({pi}[.ras]##Title## ({sigma}[.ras]##City!=Rome## k))

Notice how we are storing in `k` the result of the join between theatres and performances, this is because we can assume this join to be pretty expensive, doing it twice would be inefficient. Another possibility could be:

[.relational-algebra]
k = {pi}[.ras]##TheatreID, Title## (PERFORMANCE)

r = {sigma}[.ras]##City=Rome## THEATRE

({pi}[.ras]##Title## (r {X} k)) - ({pi}[.ras]##Title## ( (THEATRE - r) {X} k))

But it's unsure to be faster than the previous.
